Uploaded all my files to GitHub and am set up to commit any changes from local without uploading all files again and again like in the old O2Macrodevice repo.
files in the main branch are rarely edited, refer to SrcCode and Middlewares branches for any updates/changes in code!

Project on local system: C:\Users\pvash\git\O2MacrodeviceCode\NFC08A1_PollingTagDetectNDEF
